Soundtrack API
------------
Soundtrack API is a way for customers and partners to build integrations and applications on the Soundtrack platform. Maybe you'd like to build a service that changes music depending on the weather? Or enable your staff to control the music from the cash register? Or just show your visitors what's currently playing. There's a world of opportunities in making music a more integral part of your brand - and Soundtrack API can be a big part in this.
